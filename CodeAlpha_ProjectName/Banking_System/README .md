## 🧮 How It Works

1. The user enters the number of courses.
2. For each course, the user inputs:
   - Grade (e.g., 10 for A+, 9 for A, etc.)
   - Credit hours
3. The program calculates:
   - Total grade points = Σ (grade × credit hours)
   - Total credits = Σ (credit hours)
   - CGPA = total grade points / total credits
4. Displays course-wise info and final CGPA.
