**Internship Domain**: C++ Programming


**Internship Platform**: CodeAlpha 

**NAME**: Vanshika Arora

**Task Name**: Sudoku Solver

**Task Number**: Task 3

**Duration**: April 30 – June 30, 2025

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Sudoku Solver** using the backtracking algorithm in C++. The user inputs an unsolved 9x9 Sudoku grid with zeros representing empty cells. The program solves the puzzle by placing valid digits (1–9) in empty cells while obeying Sudoku rules.

It demonstrates algorithmic problem-solving, recursion, and data validation.
